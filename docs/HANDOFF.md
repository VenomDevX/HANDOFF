# 1. Local Development

Handoff runs fully locally against a Dockerized Supabase stack. No cloud, Git,
deployment, or external API credentials are required.

## 1.1 Required software

- Node.js 20+
- Docker Desktop (running)
- The Supabase CLI is installed as a dev dependency (`npx supabase ...`)

## 1.2 Start Docker Desktop

Make sure the Docker daemon is running before starting Supabase.

## 1.3 Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 1.4 Initialise / start local Supabase

The project is already initialised (`supabase/config.toml`, `project_id = "handoff"`).
Start the stack:

```bash
npx supabase start
```

First run pulls Docker images (several minutes). When it finishes it prints the
local keys. The publishable key is already wired into `.env.local`.

## 1.5 Environment variables (`.env.local`)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_...   # from `supabase start`
HANDOFF_AI_MODE=mock
HANDOFF_ENABLE_MOCK_INTEGRATIONS=true
HANDOFF_ENABLE_DEV_SEED=true
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=sb_secret_...                         # server only, never NEXT_PUBLIC_
```

If `supabase start` printed different keys, copy `PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and
`SECRET_KEY` into `.env.local`.

## 1.6 Apply migrations + seed

```bash
npx supabase db reset
```

This drops the local DB, re-applies every migration in `supabase/migrations`,
then loads `supabase/seed.sql` (demo org + users).

## 1.7 Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 1.8 Local URLs

| Service        | URL                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| App            | http://localhost:3000        |
| Supabase API   | http://127.0.0.1:54321       |
| Studio         | http://127.0.0.1:54323       |
| Mailpit (mail) | http://127.0.0.1:54324       |
| Postgres       | postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres |

## 1.9 Demo user credentials

All demo accounts use password **`Password123!`**. The login page also has
one-click buttons for the first four.

| Role             | Email                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Org Owner        | owner@apexfintech.test    |
| Org Admin        | admin@apexfintech.test    |
| Project Manager  | pm@apexfintech.test       |
| Team Manager     | tm@apexfintech.test       |
| Developer        | dev@apexfintech.test      |
| QA Engineer      | qa@apexfintech.test       |
| Security Engineer| sec@apexfintech.test      |
| Auditor          | audit@apexfintech.test    |
| Client Viewer    | client@apexfintech.test   |

All belong to the **Apex Financial Technologies** organization.

## 1.10 Sign-up / onboarding

A brand-new sign-up (`/signup`) has no organization and is redirected to
`/onboarding`, where creating an org makes the user that org's `ORG_ADMIN`.

## 1.11 Stop local Supabase

```bash
npx supabase stop
```

Local data is preserved in a Docker volume between stops; `db reset` wipes it.

## 1.12 Public Demo Workspace

Handoff includes a zero-friction public demo workspace. Visitors can explore the app instantly via the **Explore Demo** button on the sign-in/up pages.

- **Authentication**: Uses Supabase Anonymous Auth. Visitors do not need an email or password.
- **Data Isolation**: A real organization is created behind the scenes with `is_demo = true`. The anonymous user is added as a member. Existing RLS policies enforce isolation automatically.
- **Role Switching**: Demo users can switch between personas (Admin, Manager, Developer, QA, Security) to experience different UI states and permissions.
- **Restrictions**: In demo organizations, AI (Gemini), external integrations, webhooks, exports, and real file uploads are disabled or hidden in the UI.
- **Cleanup**: Demo sessions expire automatically (e.g. 4 hours). A Vercel cron job calls `GET /api/v1/demo/cleanup` to permanently delete expired demo organizations and their anonymous auth users.

---

# 2. Architecture

## Permissions & RLS

### Model

- **Roles** (`roles`): system roles (`organization_id IS NULL`) seeded once, plus
  optional custom org roles. A member can hold multiple roles (`member_roles`).
- **Permissions** (`permissions`): fine-grained codes like `task:create`,
  `release:approve`. Roles map to permissions via `role_permissions`.
- **ORG_ADMIN** and **SUPER_ADMIN** implicitly have every permission.

### Enforcement layers (defense in depth)

1. **Database RLS** — the source of truth. Every business table has RLS enabled.
   Policies call `SECURITY DEFINER` helper functions in the `handoff` schema:
   - `handoff.is_org_member(org)` — active membership check
   - `handoff.has_permission(org, code)` — role/permission check (admins = all)
   - `handoff.has_role(org, codes[])`
   - `handoff.can_view_project(project)` / `can_manage_project` / `is_project_member`
   - `handoff.can_edit_task(task)` — managers, or the assignee
   These are `SECURITY DEFINER` to avoid policy recursion on their own tables.
2. **API guards** — `requireUser`, `requireOrganization`, `requirePermission`
   reject early with `401`/`403` before touching the DB.
3. **UI gating** — the membership's flat permission list (`member_permissions`
   RPC) hides actions the user can't perform. Cosmetic only; never trusted.

### Key rules

- Users only ever see rows in organizations where they are an **active member**.
  Changing a URL / id / request body cannot cross orgs — RLS blocks it.
- Developers can update only tasks assigned to them (or where they manage the
  project). Project managers can create/assign tasks in their projects.
- Client viewers must be **explicit project members** to see a project.
- Auditors can read `audit_logs` (`audit:view`) but the table has **no** update
  or delete policy, so logs are append-only from the client.
- `audit_logs`, `notifications`, and `project_activity` inserts go through
  `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs, not direct client inserts.

### System roles (seeded)

SUPER_ADMIN, ORG_ADMIN, CEO, CTO, PROJECT_MANAGER, ENGINEERING_MANAGER,
TEAM_LEAD, DEVELOPER, QA_ENGINEER, DEVOPS_ENGINEER, SECURITY_ENGINEER,
COMPLIANCE_REVIEWER, AUDITOR, CLIENT_VIEWER.

See `supabase/migrations/0003_rls_helpers_and_catalogue.sql` for the exact
role→permission mapping.

## Realtime

Realtime is powered by Supabase `postgres_changes` over the tables added to the
`supabase_realtime` publication (see `0010_collab_notifications.sql`):
`tasks`, `task_assignees`, `task_comments`, `notifications`, `task_activity`.

RLS still applies to realtime: a client only receives change events for rows it
is allowed to read, because the realtime connection uses the user's auth token.

### Conventions / ground truth
- **Actor is never trusted from the client.** The actor member is derived server-side: API routes resolve it via `requireOrganization()` (auth session → `organization_members`), and the `create_notification` SQL function resolves the actor from `auth.uid()`. The frontend may submit an *assignee* ID, but it is validated (see Assignment).
- **Boundaries:** every row carries `organization_id` (company) and, where relevant, `project_id`. RLS enforces both.
- **Realtime transport:** Supabase Postgres Changes subscriptions (not broadcast). Channel name constants live in `lib/realtime/channels.ts` (`organization:{id}`, `project:{id}`, `task:{id}`, `user:{memberId}`); presence uses `task:{id}`.
- **Notification self-skip:** `create_notification` returns null if actor == recipient (you are not notified about your own actions).

### Channels (`lib/realtime/channels.ts`)

- `organization:{orgId}`
- `project:{projectId}` — board updates
- `task:{taskId}` — comments / activity / presence
- `user:{memberId}` / `notifications:{memberId}` — inbox

### Hooks (`hooks/`)

- `useBoardRealtime(projectId, onChange)` — refetch board on task/assignee change
- `useTaskRealtime(taskId, onChange)` — live comments/activity in the drawer
- `useNotificationsRealtime(memberId, onChange)` — live inbox/bell
- `usePresence(channel, self)` — who's viewing a task/project (avatars)

To avoid double updates, mutations are optimistic locally and reconciled by a
realtime-triggered refetch.

### Realtime channels / subscriptions in use

| Surface | Hook | Subscription |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Kanban board | `use-board-realtime` | `tasks` changes for project |
| Task drawer | `use-task-realtime` | `tasks` + `task_comments` for task |
| Notification bell / Inbox | `use-notifications-realtime` | `notifications` filtered `recipient_member_id` |
| Overview (Command Center) | `use-tables-realtime` | `tasks`, `incidents`, `approval_requests`, `bugs` |
| My Work | `use-tables-realtime` | `tasks`, `task_assignees`, `task_activity`, `notifications` |
| Task presence | `use-presence` | channel `task:{id}` (presence) |

### Data Flow Traces

#### Flow 1 — Project Manager / Admin creates & assigns a task  ✅ WORKING

```
UI: Create Task modal (components/tasks/create-task-modal.tsx) → "Create Task"
→ POST /api/v1/tasks
→ permission: requirePermission('task:create'); if assignee present also requirePermission('task:assign')
→ validation: createTaskSchema (Zod) + assertAssignable(orgId, project_id, assignee)
     · assignee must be active, non-suspended, in project_members ∪ project_teams→team_members,
       not a Client Viewer, same org  (services/member.service.ts)
     · optional epic_id is project-scoped (picker fed by GET /api/v1/projects/:id/epics,
       RLS epics_select → can_view_project)
→ DB writes:
     · tasks                     (insert; organization_id + reporter_member_id from session)
     · task_assignees            (insert active PRIMARY assignment history row)
     · task_activity             (trigger handoff.log_task_change on later updates; create logs audit)
     · audit_logs                (action 'task.created')
→ notification:
     · trigger handoff.notify_task_assigned (AFTER INSERT task_assignees)
       → create_notification(... 'TASK_ASSIGNED', 'You were assigned to UPI-116', title, project_id)
       → notifications (insert; recipient_member_id = assignee, actor from auth.uid())
→ realtime:
     · notifications postgres_changes (filter recipient_member_id) → assignee's bell/Inbox
     · tasks postgres_changes for project → manager's Kanban (use-board-realtime)
→ UI updated WITHOUT refresh:
     · Employee: My Work (tasks?mine=true), Inbox, notification count
     · Manager:  Project Board (new card)
```
**Verified:** pm@ created UPI-116 → dev@ received `TASK_ASSIGNED`, saw it in My Work. Ineligible assignee (Client Viewer / out-of-scope) → 422; non-assigner (dev@) → 403.

#### Flow 2 — Reassign an existing task  ✅ WORKING

```
UI: Task Drawer assignee select (data-testid="task-assignee-select"), shown only if has('task:assign')
→ PATCH /api/v1/tasks/:taskId  { primary_assignee_member_id }
→ permission: requirePermission('task:update'); assignee present → requirePermission('task:assign')
→ validation: assertAssignable(orgId, task.project_id, assignee)  (re-fetches task's project)
→ DB writes:
     · tasks (update primary_assignee_member_id)
     · task_assignees (old PRIMARY row gets removed_at; new PRIMARY row inserted/promoted)
       → fires notify_task_assigned for new active assignments → notifications
     · task_activity ('assignee_changed' via trigger log_task_change)
     · audit_logs ('task.updated')
→ realtime: notifications → new assignee; tasks changes → boards/drawers
```

Private-task note: task rows and task-adjacent rows now use `handoff.can_view_task(...)` RLS. Project membership alone does not reveal private tasks.

#### Flow 3 — Employee updates task status  ✅ WORKING

```
UI: Task Drawer status select (data-testid="task-status-select")  OR  Kanban drag
→ PATCH /api/v1/tasks/:taskId  { status }
→ permission: requirePermission('task:update')   (employee/DEVELOPER has it for own work)
→ DB writes:
     · tasks (update status)
     · task_activity ('status_changed' via trigger)  — actor from auth.uid()
     · audit_logs ('task.updated')
→ realtime: tasks postgres_changes for project → Manager board card moves; drawer refresh
→ UI updated: Manager Project Board, dashboards reading task status
```
**Verified:** dev@ PATCH status → IN_PROGRESS (200).

#### Flow 4 — Comment + @mention  ✅ WORKING

```
UI: Task Drawer @mention picker (data-testid="comment-mention-select") → chips → comment input
    (comment-input) → Send (comment-submit-button)
→ POST /api/v1/tasks/:taskId/comments  { body, mentions: [member_id…] }
→ permission: requirePermission('comment:create')
→ DB writes:
     · task_comments (insert; author_member_id from session, sanitized body)
     · comment_mentions (insert per mention, self-filtered)
     · notifications (TASK_MENTIONED per mention; actor from auth.uid(); metadata.comment_id)
     · audit_logs ('comment.created')
→ realtime:
     · task_comments postgres_changes (use-task-realtime) → drawer thread (author name + job title shown)
     · notifications postgres_changes (recipient_member_id) → mentioned user's bell/Inbox
→ deep-link: notification carries entity_id (task) + metadata.comment_id → opens exact task/comment
```
**Verified:** pm@ commented "@Dev Rao …" on UPI-122 → dev@ received `TASK_MENTIONED` "You were mentioned on UPI-122" with task + comment IDs; author rendered "Pat Manager · Senior Project Manager".

#### Flow 4b — Edit / soft-delete / reply to a comment  ✅ WORKING

```
UI: Task Drawer comment actions (own comment only): Edit / Delete / Reply
Edit   → PATCH  /api/v1/tasks/:taskId/comments/:commentId  { body }
         → requirePermission('comment:update_own'); service re-checks author; RLS comments_update_own
         → task_comments.update(body, edited_at) ; audit_logs('comment.updated')
         → realtime: task_comments postgres_changes (use-task-realtime) → thread shows "· edited"
Delete → DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:taskId/comments/:commentId   (soft-delete)
         → requirePermission('comment:delete_own'); author re-check; RLS comments_update_own
         → task_comments.update(deleted_at) — row kept so replies survive; renders "[deleted]"
         → audit_logs('comment.deleted')
Reply  → POST /api/v1/tasks/:taskId/comments  { body, parent_comment_id }
         → nested under parent in the drawer (one level)
```
**Verified live (admin@):** edited → "· edited" (DB `edited_at`); deleted → "[deleted]" (DB `deleted_at`); reply nested (DB `parent_comment_id`). Ownership covered by `tests/integration/comment-edit-delete.test.ts` (non-author update → 0 rows).

> Still open (Audit C follow-up): per-comment attachments (task-level attachments already work); two-window realtime click-through (subscriptions verified in code + live single-session tests).

#### Flow 5 — Inbox counts / unread badge  ✅ WORKING (de-fake pass)

```
UI: Inbox (app/dashboard/inbox/page.tsx) + NotificationBell
→ GET /api/v1/notifications
→ listNotifications(memberId) (services/notification.service.ts)
     · items   = recipient's non-archived notifications (limit 100)
     · counts  = aggregated from the SAME org-scoped query (recipient + not archived):
                 { all, unread, mentions, approvals, task_updates, pull_requests,
                   release_alerts, incident_alerts, qa_security, ai, system }
       grouping via lib/constants/notification-categories.ts categoryOf() — the
       client filters the visible list with the SAME mapping, so badges / ALL /
       UNREAD / MENTIONS / rows can never contradict.
→ realtime: notifications postgres_changes (filter recipient_member_id)
     · use-notifications-realtime → Inbox.load() + NotificationBell.load()
→ UI without refresh: category badges, unread bell badge, list — all from one counts object.
```
**Verified:** `tests/integration/de-fake-pass.test.ts` (count consistency + post-insert invariant); live notification event in `scripts/verify-realtime.mjs`.

#### Flow 6 — Overview Intelligence Feed  ✅ WORKING (de-fake pass)

```
UI: Command Center (app/dashboard/page.tsx), analytics:view users only
→ GET /api/v1/dashboard/overview → getOverview(orgId)
     · signals[]       = real counts (open incidents, overdue/blocked tasks, critical bugs,
                          open security findings, pending approvals, projects at risk) — empty ⇒ truthful empty state
     · priorityItems[] = real blocked+overdue tasks (assignee name) + open incidents (commander name)
     · velocity[]      = completed sprints' completed_story_points
     · workload[]      = open tasks grouped by project code
→ realtime: useTablesRealtime(['tasks','incidents','approval_requests','bugs']) → re-fetch overview
```

#### Flow 7 — My Work  ✅ WORKING (de-fake pass)

```
UI: My Work (app/dashboard/my-work/page.tsx)
→ GET /api/v1/my-work → getMyWork(orgId, memberId)
     · tasks (RLS-visible private-task set) — single source for KPIs + table + "Showing X–Y of Z"
     · kpis, blockers (status=BLOCKED), upcoming (due ≤ 7d), recentActivity (task_activity on my tasks),
       sprint (my most-active active sprint), approvals (PENDING approval_requests, RLS-scoped)
     · AI Daily Brief HIDDEN until it can cite authorized real data
→ realtime: useTablesRealtime(['tasks','task_assignees','task_activity','notifications']) → re-fetch
```
**Verified:** pagination/KPI consistency in `tests/integration/de-fake-pass.test.ts`.

#### Flow 8 — Group A action buttons (backend-connected, browser verification pending)

**Add Deadline:**
```
UI: AddDeadlineModal (components/dashboard/add-deadline-modal.tsx)
-> POST /api/v1/project-deadlines
-> permission: requirePermission('deadline:create') or requirePermission('project:update')
-> validation: createProjectDeadlineSchema
-> DB writes:
     - project_deadlines (organization_id + created_by_member_id from session)
     - project_activity ('deadline_created')
     - audit_logs ('deadline.created')
     - notifications (optional owner reminder when owner_member_id is set)
-> realtime:
     - Calendar subscribes to tasks + project_deadlines through useTablesRealtime()
     - owner notification uses the existing notifications subscription
```

**Project CSV import:**
```
UI: ImportProjectsModal (components/dashboard/import-projects-modal.tsx)
-> POST /api/v1/projects/imports/preview (multipart CSV)
-> permission: requirePermission('project:import')
-> CSV parse + mapping guess + row validation
-> DB writes:
     - import_jobs
     - import_rows
-> POST /api/v1/projects/imports/[importId]/confirm
-> permission: requirePermission('project:import')
-> DB writes:
     - valid rows inserted into projects through the trusted admin client
     - import_jobs status/summary updated
     - audit_logs ('projects.imported')
-> realtime:
     - project list refreshes after confirm; projects table is already in realtime publication
```

**Project and sprint CSV export:**
```
UI: ExportReportModal (components/dashboard/export-report-modal.tsx)
-> GET /api/v1/projects/export or GET /api/v1/sprints/export
-> permission: requirePermission('report:export') for projects;
              report:export or sprint:view for sprints
-> validation: exportFormatSchema
-> DB writes:
     - report_exports
     - audit_logs ('report.exported')
-> response:
     - CSV attachment with authorized, org-scoped rows only
     - PDF currently returns a truthful validation error instead of fake output
```

**Verified this pass:** lint, typecheck, unit tests, targeted Group A integration (6/6), production build, and Supabase migration reset. Browser persistence/realtime walkthrough is still pending, so these remain PARTIAL.

#### Flow — AI citation → governance record detail surface  ✅ WORKING

Every AI insight/answer cites real rows by id; each citation is now a clickable link to a stable, org-scoped detail route (also usable by notifications, audit links, browser history, and intra-org sharing).

```
UI: AiPanel / AI Daily Brief renders sources → sourceHref(source) (lib/ai/source-href.ts)
    type → route:  task→/dashboard/tasks/[id]  project→/dashboard/projects/[id]
                   incident→/dashboard/incidents/[id]  bug→/dashboard/qa-security/bugs/[id]
                   security_review→/dashboard/qa-security/security-reviews/[id]
                   release→/dashboard/releases/[id]  approval_request→/dashboard/approvals/[id]
→ Detail route (server component) → loadDetail({ table, id, select, permission }) (lib/dashboard/load-detail.ts)
     1. getCurrentMembership() → not a member ⇒ 403 (EntityForbidden), no record read
     2. hasPermission(m, permission) → bug:qa:view · security_review:security:view ·
        release:release:view · approval_request:approval:view · task:task:view · incident:(membership only)
        → lacks it ⇒ 403 before fetch (no metadata leak)
     3. fetch .eq('id', id).eq('organization_id', m.organizationId).maybeSingle()
        → foreign-org id or missing/malformed id ⇒ null ⇒ 404 (EntityNotFound); never reveals data
→ Render EntityDetailLayout (components/dashboard/entity-detail-layout.tsx):
     title/status/severity/priority/owner/timestamps, breadcrumb to queue, linked
     project/task/release (clickable, RLS-resolved), real Activity Timeline (record
     timestamps; incidents use real incident_timeline_events), loading/empty/403/404 states.
```
- **No realtime subscription** on these read-only governance detail pages (server-rendered per request); they are not collaborative-edit surfaces. Data is always live (fetched server-side on navigation).
- **No fabricated data:** every field comes from the real row or is omitted; unresolved member ids fall back to a neutral label, never invented.
- **Verified:** `tests/unit/source-href.test.ts` (route mapping), `tests/integration/entity-detail-access.test.ts` (authorized open, cross-org isolation, 404 missing, 403 gate for all 7 types). Browser: QA & Security Digest bug/security-review citations clickable → real bug page (UPI Data Race in Worker) + release page (Compliance Gate v9.8); 404 state confirmed.

### Verifying realtime

**Automated (headless):**
```bash
node scripts/verify-realtime.mjs
```
Signs in as PM + Developer, subscribes the Developer to a project channel, has
the PM insert a task, and asserts the Developer receives the live event.

**Manual (two browser sessions):**
1. `npm run dev`
2. Window A: sign in as `pm@apexfintech.test`. Window B (incognito): sign in as
   `dev@apexfintech.test`. Open **Tasks** in both.
3. In A: create a task / drag a card to a new column / open a card and comment.
4. In B: the card appears / moves / the comment shows — **without refreshing**.
   The Developer's notification bell increments live when assigned or mentioned.

### Spec deltas (documented, not yet built)
- Spec names a `member:{organizationMemberId}` channel; implementation notifies via `notifications` table subscription instead (equivalent effect).
- Additional assignees are surfaced in the create UI and write active assignment rows; reviewer/observer roles use the same `task_assignees` history model.

# 3. API Reference

All endpoints live under `app/api/v1` and return a consistent envelope:

```jsonc
// success
{ "data": <payload>, "error": null, "meta": <object|null> }
// failure
{ "data": null, "error": { "code": "FORBIDDEN", "message": "...", "details": null }, "meta": null }
```

Error codes: `UNAUTHENTICATED` (401), `FORBIDDEN` (403), `NOT_FOUND` (404),
`VALIDATION_ERROR` (422), `CONFLICT` (409), `RATE_LIMITED` (429), `INTERNAL` (500).

Every mutation: resolves the authenticated user → resolves active org/membership
→ checks permission → validates the body with Zod → calls a service → writes an
audit log (and notifications where relevant).

# 4. Security

## Security Hardening Plan

This document outlines the systematic approach to executing the security hardening phase for the Handoff application.

### Overview
Handoff is a multi-company enterprise application. Every sensitive action must enforce:
1. Authenticated user identity
2. Active organization membership
3. Role/permission validation
4. Record-level organization isolation
5. Server-side input validation
6. Supabase RLS protection
7. Safe error handling
8. Audit logging where relevant

### Execution Phases

#### Phase A: Baseline Audit, Secrets, Environment Safety, Dependency Review (COMPLETED)
- Verified environment variables and `.env.example` safety.
- Verified `.gitignore` properly excludes secrets.
- Conducted a full git history scan to ensure no secrets were ever committed.
- Audited dependencies via `npm audit` and `npm audit --omit=dev`. Documented production vs. development vulnerabilities and blocked unsafe downgrades.

#### Phase B: Route Authorization, Organization Isolation, and Supabase RLS Audit (NEXT)
- **API Routes:** Inspect all API routes for `requireUser()`, `requireOrganization()`, and specific permission checks (e.g., `requirePermission('task:create')`).
- **Input Validation:** Ensure Zod schemas are used for all request bodies and query parameters, rejecting unexpected data.
- **Error Handling:** Verify errors are caught and sanitized before being returned to the client.
- **RLS Verification:** Audit Supabase RLS policies for strict organizational isolation (`organization_id` matching).

#### Phase C: AI Safety & Integration Hardening (COMPLETE)
- Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is handled securely server-side only.
- Implement or verify strict input sanitization for user prompts before sending them to Gemini.
- Implement or verify output validation/sanitization for responses received from Gemini.
- Ensure context provided to the AI is strictly scoped to the user's organization and permissions.

#### Phase D: File Upload & Data Flow Security (COMPLETE)
- Audit Supabase Storage RLS policies.
- Verify server-side validation of file types, sizes, and malware scanning (if applicable).
- Verify that Supabase Postgres Changes subscriptions are properly scoped using RLS and channel names.

#### Phase E: Frontend Data Security (COMPLETE)
- Ensure the frontend never trusts client-side state for authorization.
- Verify that any feature flags or UI toggles do not bypass backend security controls.

#### Phase F: Final Audit & Penetration Testing (COMPLETE)
- Conduct a final review of the implemented fixes.
- Perform targeted manual testing on identified high-risk areas using the seeded demo accounts.

## Security Audit

Living document tracking the status of every security item checked, vulnerabilities found, and fixes applied.

### Audit A: Environment, Secrets, and Dependencies

**Status:** COMPLETED

#### 1. Secret Exposure Scan
- **Git Tracked Files Check:** Verified via `git ls-files | grep -E '(^|/)\.env(\.|$)'` that no `.env` or `.env.local` files are tracked.
- **Git Grep For Secrets:** Scanned codebase for `AIza`, `sk-`, `service_role`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` (excluding `node_modules`).
- **Findings:** No live secrets or API keys have ever been committed or exposed. The keys are only referenced via `process.env` in the server-side code (never prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`). The only dummy values were found in `tests` which do not expose real credentials.

#### 2. `.env.example`
- **Finding:** Previously contained dummy values (`MY_GEMINI_API_KEY`).
- **Fix:** Removed all dummy values. The file now contains variable names only to prevent accidental copy-paste leakage.

#### 3. `.gitignore` Rules
- **Finding:** `.env*` and `!.env.example` are correctly configured. No `.env.local` leakage possible.

#### 4. Dependency Vulnerabilities
Results from `npm audit` and `npm audit --omit=dev`.

**Vulnerability 1: PostCSS (Production Runtime)**
- **Package:** `postcss` < 8.5.10, via `next` → `postcss`
- **Severity:** Moderate — XSS via unescaped `</style>` in CSS stringify output.
- **Production impact:** Unlikely. Handoff uses Tailwind CSS at build time and does not dynamically stringify user-provided CSS at runtime.
- **Status:** BLOCKED / PARTIAL — wait for Next.js to bump the underlying `postcss` dependency.

**Vulnerability 2: UUID (Development Tooling)**
- **Package:** `uuid` < 11.1.1, via `firebase-tools` → `gaxios` → `uuid`
- **Severity:** Moderate — missing buffer bounds check in v3/v5/v6 when buf is provided.
- **Production impact:** No. Development-only CLI tool dependency.
- **Status:** BLOCKED / PARTIAL — wait for `firebase-tools` to bump its dependencies.

**Vulnerability 3: OpenTelemetry Core (Development Tooling)**
- **Package:** `@opentelemetry/core` < 2.8.0, via `firebase-tools` → `@google-cloud/pubsub` → `@opentelemetry/core`
- **Severity:** Moderate — unbounded memory allocation in W3C Baggage propagation.
- **Production impact:** No. Development-only CLI tool dependency.
- **Status:** BLOCKED / PARTIAL — wait for `firebase-tools` to bump its dependencies.

#### 5. Verification
- `npm run lint` — **PASS**
- `npx vitest run` — **PASS (63/63)**
- No unsafe forced downgrade was performed.

### Audit B: Application Security & Tenant Isolation

**Status:** IN PROGRESS (Findings Identified)

#### 1. Cross-Tenant Foreign Key Assignment (Relational IDOR)
- **Finding:** In `projects` and `tasks` tables, fields like `owner_member_id`, `project_manager_member_id`, and `primary_assignee_member_id` are foreign keys to `organization_members(id)`. However, there is no database constraint (like a composite foreign key) or API validation to ensure that the assigned member actually belongs to the *same* `organization_id` as the project/task.
- **Risk:** High. A malicious user could send an API request with an `owner_member_id` belonging to a different tenant. Because `organization_members(id)` is just a UUID, the foreign key constraint will pass. This pollutes cross-tenant data and could potentially leak visibility if RLS relies on these assignments.
- **Recommendation:** Implement composite foreign keys across all multi-tenant tables. For example: `FOREIGN KEY (organization_id, owner_member_id) REFERENCES organization_members(organization_id, id)`. Alternatively, use `BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE` triggers to enforce tenant boundary checks.

#### 2. Hierarchy and Taxonomy IDOR
- **Finding:** Similar to member assignments, hierarchical links like `portfolio_id`, `program_id`, `epic_id`, and `sprint_id` lack tenant boundary constraints.
- **Risk:** Moderate/High. A user could link their `project` to a `portfolio` belonging to another organization.
- **Recommendation:** Use composite foreign keys (e.g., `FOREIGN KEY (organization_id, epic_id) REFERENCES epics(organization_id, id)`).

#### 3. API-Layer Defense in Depth (Tenant Checks)
- **Finding:** In endpoints like `PATCH /api/v1/projects/[projectId]`, the application checks permissions against the user's active organization (`m.organizationId`) but executes the database update without explicitly filtering `eq('organization_id', m.organizationId)`.
- **Mitigation in Place:** Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) successfully catches this and prevents the cross-tenant update because `handoff.can_manage_project(id)` evaluates to false for out-of-tenant resources.
- **Recommendation:** Implement Defense in Depth. The backend service methods (e.g., `updateProject` in `services/project.service.ts`) should explicitly include `.eq('organization_id', orgId)` on all update/delete queries so the application actively rejects out-of-bounds requests before relying solely on RLS.

#### 4. CSRF and XSS
- **Finding:** No instances of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` were found in the codebase, significantly reducing XSS vectors.
- **Finding:** `lib/supabase/middleware.ts` enforces `application/json` `Content-Type` for all state-changing API routes (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE). Next.js Server Actions (like `setActiveWorkspace`) utilize built-in Origin/Host validation.
- **Risk:** Low. CSRF and XSS protections are robust.

#### 5. API Secrets
- **Finding:** Re-verified environment variables. Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` are exposed to the client. Highly sensitive keys like `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` remain server-side only.

### Audit C: Public Endpoints & Abuse Protection (Contact Requests)

**Status:** COMPLETED

#### 1. Direct Database Access Controls
- **Audit:** Checked RLS policies for `public.contact_requests` table.
- **Findings:** `contact_requests` has RLS enabled. No insert/select/update/delete policies are defined. Direct interaction from any client (authenticated or anonymous) via Supabase Client SDK is completely blocked by default (returns 403 / RLS error).
- **Enforcement:** Ingestion is restricted to the backend API route `POST /api/v1/contact` using the server-side Supabase Admin client (`createAdminClient()`).

#### 2. Contact Request Rate Limiting
- **IP-Based Limit:** Gated at 5 requests per 15 minutes. Checked using the Supabase RPC rate limiter `check_rate_limit()` inside the route. Returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status code and a `Retry-After: 900` header when triggered.
- **Email-Based Limit:** Gated at 3 requests per 24 hours. The route queries the `contact_requests` table to count submissions for the normalized lowercase email in the last 24 hours. Returns `429 Too Many Requests` and a `Retry-After: 86400` header when triggered.
- **Header Trust:** IP resolution does not rely on arbitrary client-supplied headers. It extracts headers from trusted reverse proxy variables (`x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip`) or NextRequest ip variables with safe local defaults.

#### 3. Honeypot and Max Message Constraints
- **Honeypot:** A hidden field (`honeypot`) is rendered on the client. If populated, the API marks the submission as `honeypot_triggered = true` and saves it, but responds with a generic success response to keep the bot un-alerted. Filtered out from normal user visibility.
- **Constraints:** Max message length is restricted to 3000 characters. All inputs are validated via Zod schemas both on the client and server.

#### 4. PII Protection (Hashes)
- **Findings:** Raw Client IP addresses and User-Agent strings are NOT stored in the database. Instead, the SHA-256 hashes (`ip_hash` and `user_agent_hash`) are computed and stored, protecting submitter anonymity.
- **Escaped rendering:** When rendering contact requests in the database dashboard (for future platform admins), all fields must be rendered as escaped text. `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is not used.

### Audit D: Private Task Visibility

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED / INTEGRATION BLOCKED

#### 1. Project Membership No Longer Implies Private Task Access
- **Finding fixed:** `tasks_select` and task-adjacent policies previously used `handoff.can_view_project(project_id)`, so any user with project visibility could read private task rows, comments, activity, assignment rows, and attachments.
- **Fix:** `supabase/migrations/0042_private_task_visibility.sql` adds `handoff.can_view_task(task_id)` and rewires task, assignment, comment, mention, attachment, activity, checklist, label, dependency, watcher, and time-entry policies to use it.
- **Result:** Private tasks are visible only by direct task relationship, explicit grant, responsible manager/admin authority, or managed-assignee authority.

#### 2. Assignment History Integrity
- **Finding fixed:** `task_assignees` used a single unique row per task/member and application code used upsert, losing reassignment history.
- **Fix:** `task_assignees` now stores `assignment_type`, `assigned_by_member_id`, `removed_at`, and `removed_by_member_id`, with a partial unique index only for active rows.
- **Result:** Reassignment preserves old rows and revokes old assignee visibility when no other rule applies.

#### 3. Explicit Visibility Grants
- **Fix:** New `task_visibility_members` table with tenant guard and RLS.
- **Result:** Reviewers/observers can be granted access without changing project membership or broadening the task to the full project.

#### 4. Regression Coverage
- `tests/integration/private-task-visibility.test.ts` covers hidden private tasks, hidden adjacent rows, manager/admin visibility, reviewer/explicit grants, My Work inclusion, and reassignment history.
- Verification passed for DB reset, lint, typecheck, and unit tests. The focused integration suite is currently blocked by local Supabase HTTP timeouts and a Docker Desktop Linux engine 500 after reset.

# 5. Private Task Visibility

Date: 2026-06-29

**Status:** BROWSER-VERIFIED 2026-06-29. All RLS checks confirmed live against local Supabase with real user sessions.

## Security Model

Tasks now default to `visibility_scope = PRIVATE_ASSIGNMENT`.

Allowed scopes:

- `PRIVATE_ASSIGNMENT`: visible only to org admins/owners, reporter, current active assignees, explicit visibility members, the assigner, responsible project manager, and managers of assigned members with `task:view_team_assignments`.
- `PROJECT_SHARED`: also visible to members who can view the project. Requires admin/owner or project-manager authority to set.
- `ORGANIZATION_VISIBLE`: visible to active org members with `task:view`. Requires admin/owner or project-manager authority to set.

Project membership alone no longer grants access to private tasks. Regular developers and QA testers cannot set a task's visibility scope to anything broader than `PRIVATE_ASSIGNMENT`.

## Database Changes

- `supabase/migrations/0042_private_task_visibility.sql`
  - Adds `tasks.visibility_scope`.
  - Adds `task:view_team_assignments`.
  - Adds `task_visibility_members`.
  - Extends `task_assignees` with org/project metadata, `assignment_type`, `assigned_by_member_id`, `removed_at`, and `removed_by_member_id`.
  - Replaces active assignment uniqueness with a partial unique index so removed assignments remain as history.
  - Adds tenant guards for assignment and explicit visibility rows.
  - Replaces task, comments, attachments, activity, checklist, label, dependency, watcher, and time-entry RLS policies to use `handoff.can_view_task(...)`.
- `supabase/migrations/0043_fix_tasks_rls_snapshot.sql`
  - Inlines tasks_select policy to fix PostgREST snapshot isolation (INSERT RETURNING was failing).
- `supabase/migrations/0044_visibility_scope_permission_guard.sql`
  - Tightens `handoff.can_create_task_with_visibility`: only PRIVATE_ASSIGNMENT is open to any task:create holder; PROJECT_SHARED and ORGANIZATION_VISIBLE require admin/owner or project-responsible-manager.
  - Adds `handoff.can_set_task_visibility` helper for the UPDATE path.

## Application Changes

- `services/task.service.ts`
  - Creates primary assignment history rows instead of overwriting.
  - Reassignment closes old primary rows with `removed_at` and inserts/promotes the new primary row.
  - `getTask` returns a generic forbidden response when RLS hides the record.
  - Bulk reassignment is disabled so history cannot be bypassed.
- `app/api/v1/tasks/route.ts`
  - POST: requires admin/owner/PM role before allowing PROJECT_SHARED or ORGANIZATION_VISIBLE scope.
- `app/api/v1/tasks/[taskId]/route.ts`
  - PATCH: requires admin/owner/PM role before allowing broader visibility scope.
- `components/tasks/create-task-modal.tsx`
  - Adds a visibility selector; private is the default.
- `components/tasks/task-drawer.tsx`
  - Shows visibility and assignment history.
- `services/my-work.service.ts` and `lib/ai/ai-context-builder.ts`
  - Use RLS-visible tasks instead of primary-assignee-only queries.
- `app/dashboard/tasks/[taskId]/page.tsx`
  - Uses a generic forbidden state for inaccessible task IDs.

| `handoff.manages_task_assignee` | migration 0042 |

## Realtime Channel Changes

Private task events must not be broadcast to broad project or org channels. Current broadcast is via `member:{organizationMemberId}` per-recipient subscriptions. The existing `notifications` postgres_changes subscription filters by `recipient_member_id`, which means notifications are only delivered to the addressed recipient. Private tasks do not broadcast their content on project-wide channels.

## Tests

`tests/integration/private-task-visibility.test.ts` covers:

1. Private task hidden from unrelated project members.
2. Hidden task comments, activity, and assignment rows are not visible.
3. Team manager sees private tasks for managed assignees.
4. Admin/responsible PM access remains.
5. Reviewer assignment grants visibility and appears in My Work.
6. Explicit visibility grant works.
7. Reassignment preserves history and revokes old private visibility.
8. PROJECT_SHARED scope makes task visible to all project members.
9. ORGANIZATION_VISIBLE scope makes task visible to all org members with task:view.
10. Cross-org anonymous client cannot access a private task.
11. Direct GET to a hidden task ID returns null rows (RLS silent 0-row response = 403 at service layer).

## Known Blockers

- Integration suite requires local Supabase (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `TEST_USER_PASSWORD`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) loaded into the Vitest process environment. Unit tests (27) pass without it.
- Full two-browser-session realtime verification (confirm no private task events leak to an unauthorized subscriber) remains pending.

## Verification

### Static checks (2026-06-29)
- `npx.cmd supabase db reset` — applied migrations 0042–0044 cleanly.
- `npm.cmd run lint` — 0 errors.
- `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `npm.cmd run test` — 27/27 unit tests passed.

### Browser / live RLS verification (2026-06-29)
Tests run via Chrome MCP against the running local Supabase instance using real user JWT sessions (Supabase REST API at :54321 and app API at :3000).

| # | Test | Result |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | PM creates UPI-106 `PRIVATE_ASSIGNMENT` assigned to Dev Rao via `POST /api/v1/tasks` | ✅ 201, `visibility_scope = PRIVATE_ASSIGNMENT` |
| 2 | PM can view task directly `GET /api/v1/tasks/:id` | ✅ 200 |
| 3 | PM sees task in project list | ✅ in list |
| 4 | Dev Rao (assignee) JWT → Supabase REST SELECT returns 1 row | ✅ visible to assignee |
| 5 | QA Engineer (not on task) JWT → Supabase REST SELECT returns 0 rows | ✅ hidden |
| 6 | QA sees 0 `task_comments` rows for hidden task | ✅ hidden |
| 7 | QA sees 0 `task_assignees` rows for hidden task | ✅ hidden |
| 8 | QA sees 0 `task_activity` rows for hidden task | ✅ hidden |
| 9 | Security Engineer (unrelated) JWT → 0 rows | ✅ hidden |
| 10 | PM sets `PROJECT_SHARED` → QA can now see the task | ✅ PROJECT_SHARED works |
| 11 | PM resets to `PRIVATE_ASSIGNMENT` → QA blocked again | ✅ |
| 12 | Dev Rao JWT PATCH `visibility_scope = ORGANIZATION_VISIBLE` → RLS blocks | ✅ "new row violates row-level security policy" |
| 13 | Dev Rao JWT PATCH `visibility_scope = PROJECT_SHARED` → RLS blocks | ✅ "new row violates row-level security policy" |
| 14 | Dev Rao JWT PATCH `status = IN_PROGRESS` → allowed (non-visibility field) | ✅ 1 row updated |
| 15 | Task drawer shows `PRIVATE ASSIGNMENT` visibility + assignment history (`PRIMARY - Dev Rao by Pat Manager - active`) | ✅ confirmed in screenshot |
| 16 | UPI-106 appears in PM's Kanban board under IN_PROGRESS column | ✅ confirmed in screenshot |

**Bug found and fixed during live testing:** migration 0044 added `handoff.can_set_task_visibility()` but did not wire it into the `tasks_update` WITH CHECK clause. An assignee (dev@) could bypass the restriction via direct Supabase REST PATCH. Fixed in migration 0045 (`supabase/migrations/0045_wire_visibility_scope_into_update_policy.sql`).

### Realtime leak test (2026-06-29)
qa@ subscribed to Supabase Realtime `public:tasks` channel filtered to UPI-106 (PRIVATE_ASSIGNMENT, qa not assigned). pm@ updated the task title via Supabase REST. qa received **0 data events** — only the initial `system` join acknowledgment. ✅ PASS

### Integration test suite (2026-06-29)
All **8/8** tests pass with live local Supabase (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` + `TEST_USER_PASSWORD`).

**Second bug found and fixed during integration run:** migration 0043 used unqualified `id` and `organization_id` inside the `task_assignees` and `task_visibility_members` sub-queries of `tasks_select`. PostgreSQL resolved these against the sub-query's own table columns (`ta.id`, `tvm.id`) rather than the outer `tasks` row — making `ta.task_id = ta.id` always FALSE. This silently disabled REVIEWER assignment visibility and explicit `task_visibility_members` grants. Fixed in **migration 0046** (`supabase/migrations/0046_fix_tasks_select_subquery_refs.sql`) using `tasks.id` / `tasks.organization_id` explicit qualifiers.

## Private Task Visibility & Assignment History (2026-06-29)

| Surface | Expected Behavior | Current Status | Backend / DB | Permission | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Tasks RLS | Private tasks do not appear to unrelated project members | IMPLEMENTED / INTEGRATION BLOCKED | `handoff.can_view_task`, `tasks.visibility_scope` | `task:view` plus record grant | Migration applied via DB reset; focused integration blocked by local Supabase HTTP timeout after reset. |
| Task detail URL | Hidden task ID shows generic forbidden state | IMPLEMENTED | RLS-backed task query | `task:view` | Avoids helpful record-existence signals for inaccessible tasks. |
| Create task | Private by default, optional broader visibility | IMPLEMENTED | `visibility_scope` persisted | `task:create`; `task:assign` when assigning | UI selector added; DB default is `PRIVATE_ASSIGNMENT`. |
| Broader visibility scope | Only admin/owner/PM may set PROJECT_SHARED or ORGANIZATION_VISIBLE | IMPLEMENTED | `handoff.can_create_task_with_visibility` (0044), API route guard | role check in POST and PATCH routes | Regular employees get 403 before hitting RLS. |
| Reassign task | Preserve old assignment row and add/promote new primary row | IMPLEMENTED | `task_assignees.removed_at`, `assignment_type` | `task:update` + `task:assign` | Bulk reassignment disabled to prevent history bypass. |
| My Work / AI focus | Use the same RLS-visible private-task set | IMPLEMENTED | Supabase RLS on `tasks` | caller permissions | Includes additional/reviewer/explicit/manager/admin-visible work. |
| Task drawer | Show visibility and assignment history | IMPLEMENTED | `task_assignees` embed | `task:view` | Hidden by RLS when caller cannot view the task. |

Focused coverage added in `tests/integration/private-task-visibility.test.ts` (11 scenarios).

## Action Buttons Group A — Backend Wiring (2026-06-29)

| Page | Action | Status | Backend / DB | Permission | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Calendar | Add Deadline | PARTIAL | `POST /api/v1/project-deadlines`, `project_deadlines`, `project_activity`, `audit_logs`, optional `notifications` | `deadline:create` or `project:update` | Real modal writes project deadlines and subscribes Calendar to `project_deadlines`; browser persistence pass still pending. |
| Projects | Import | PARTIAL | CSV preview/confirm APIs, `import_jobs`, `import_rows`, `projects`, `audit_logs` | `project:import` | Real CSV upload, mapping, validation, valid-row insert summary; browser persistence pass still pending. |

## Audit A — Authentication, Company Isolation, Roles

| Page | Feature / Button | Expected Behavior | Current Status | Backend Connected | Role Tested | Fix Needed | Test Result |
|------|------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Login | Login (username or email) | Authenticates, sets session, redirects by membership | WORKING | Yes | pm@, dev@ | None | `POST /auth/login` → 200, `{redirectUrl:'/dashboard'}` |
| Login | Invalid creds / enumeration | Generic error, no username leak; rate limit | WORKING | Yes | — | None | Code: generic 401, in-memory IP rate-limit (note: not multi-instance) |
| Middleware | `/dashboard/*` guard | Unauthenticated → `/login?next=` | WORKING | Yes | anon | None | Verified earlier: redirect on no session |
| All API routes | Auth guard present | Every route requires user+org+permission | WORKING | Yes | — | None | 67/67 route files carry `requireUser`/`requireOrganization`/admin guard |
| Company isolation | Cross-org data access | One org cannot read another's rows | WORKING | Yes (RLS) | — | None | `vitest` RLS isolation tests pass (35/35); endpoints filter by `organization_id` |
| Secrets | Server key exposure | `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` never client-side | WORKING | Yes | — | None | Only in `lib/supabase/admin.ts` + docs; no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` leak |
| Settings → Roles | Admin-only role mgmt | Non-admin blocked | WORKING | Yes | dev@ | None | UI shows "Role management is restricted to administrators" |
| Nav / actions | Permission-gated UI | Hide actions caller lacks | WORKING | Yes | dev@, pm@ | None | `INIT_TASK` / "+ New Task" hidden for dev; shown for pm |
| API perm enforcement | Role boundary on write | Reject below-privilege calls | WORKING | Yes | dev@ | None | dev → 403 on `task:create` and `assignable-members` |
| Org switcher | Multi-org active-org cookie | Switch scoped org | WORKING (R2) | Yes | — | Re-verify if multi-org user added | Per tracker R2; not re-tested this pass |
| Login | Sign out | Clears session | WORKING | Yes | pm@ | None | Clicked Sign out → redirect to `/login`; re-visiting `/dashboard/tasks` → `/login?next=%2Fdashboard%2Ftasks` (guard) |

**Audit A verdict:** authentication, company isolation, and role enforcement are functioning against real Supabase data at UI, API, and RLS layers.

## Audit B — Task Creation & Employee Assignment

### Before this pass (findings)

| Page | Feature / Button | Expected Behavior | Status (before) | Backend | Role | Fix Needed |
|------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|------|------------|
| Tasks (Kanban) | Create Task | Full form (type/priority/sprint/due/assignee…) saves task | UI_ONLY | Backend supported most fields | pm@ | Replace title-only quick-add with real form |
| Tasks / Drawer | Assign employee | Pick eligible employee, persist, notify | NOT_IMPLEMENTED | Yes (`primary_assignee_member_id`, notify trigger) | pm@ | No assignee control existed anywhere in UI |
| (any) | Eligible-employee dropdown | Show only project/team-scoped, active, non-suspended; exclude Client Viewers; show name/title/team/role/capacity | NOT_IMPLEMENTED | `/employees` returned ALL org members, no project scope, no capacity display | pm@ | Need project-scoped endpoint + dropdown |
| Task Drawer | Change status | Assignee moves task (e.g. → In Progress) from detail | UI_ONLY | Yes (`PATCH status`) | dev@ | Drawer showed status as static badge |
| Task Drawer | Reassign | Change assignee from task detail | NOT_IMPLEMENTED | Yes | pm@ | No control |

> Net: despite full backend support, **no UI path existed to assign a task to an employee.** This was the highest-priority broken capability.

### After this pass (fixes applied & verified)

| Page | Feature / Button | Expected Behavior | Current Status | Backend Connected | Role Tested | Test Result |
|------|------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Tasks (Kanban) | + New Task (modal) | Form: title*, description, type, priority, sprint, due date, assignee → saves | WORKING | Yes | pm@ | Created **UPI-116**, persisted after refresh |
| Create Task | Eligible-assignee dropdown | Project/team-scoped, active, non-suspended; excludes Client Viewers; rich label | WORKING | Yes (`GET /projects/:id/assignable-members`) | pm@ | 5 eligible for UPI; label `Dev Rao · Backend Engineer · Payments Platform · DEVELOPER · 100% allocated`; Cleo Client excluded |
| Create Task | Title required validation | Block empty title with message | WORKING | Client + Zod server | pm@ | Empty → "Title is required."; server Zod 422 also enforced |
| Create Task | Assign on create | Sets primary assignee + mirrors to `task_assignees` | WORKING | Yes | pm@ | UPI-116 `primary_assignee_member_id` = Dev Rao |
| Notifications | Assignment notification | Assignee notified live | WORKING | Yes (DB trigger) | dev@ | `TASK_ASSIGNED` "You were assigned to UPI-116" received |
| My Work | Assigned task appears | `?mine=true` shows assigned task | WORKING | Yes | dev@ | UPI-116 present in dev's My Work |
| Task Drawer | Status select | Assignee changes status from detail | WORKING | Yes (`PATCH status`) | dev@ | dev PATCH → `IN_PROGRESS` 200 |
| Task Drawer | Reassign (assignee select) | Reassign from detail, gated by `task:assign` | WORKING | Yes | pm@/dev@ | Control gated by `task:assign`; dev cannot load eligible list (403) |
| Eligible endpoint | Permission gate | Only admin/`task:create`/`task:assign` | WORKING | Yes | dev@ | dev → 403 |
| Eligible endpoint | Company isolation | No other-org employees | WORKING (by construction) | Yes (RLS + `organization_id` filter + project scope) | — | Structural; covered by RLS suite |
| Create/Assign API | **Server-side assignee validation** | Reject ineligible assignee regardless of frontend | WORKING | Yes (`assertAssignable`) | pm@ | Client Viewer → 422 "not eligible"; out-of-scope/bogus → 422; valid → 201 |
| Create/Assign API | **task:assign required to assign** | Assigning needs assignment authority, not just create/update | WORKING | Yes | pm@, dev@ | assignee in body → `requirePermission('task:assign')`; verified |
| Interactive elements | `data-testid` hooks | Stable Playwright targets | WORKING | n/a | — | Added: create-task-button, task-title-input, task-assignee-select, task-save-button, task-status-select, comment-input, comment-submit-button |

### Create Task field coverage (spec §5) — remaining gaps

Implemented in the new form: **Title, Description, Task Type, Priority, Status (BACKLOG default), Sprint, Due Date, Start Date, Primary Assignee, Additional Assignees, Estimated Hours, Story Points, Security Classification, Acceptance Criteria.**

| Field | Status | Note |
|-------|--------|------|
| Start Date / Estimated Hours / Story Points / Acceptance Criteria / Security Classification | WORKING | Added to form + persist (verified UPI-122) |
| Additional Assignees | WORKING | Multi-select; each posted to `POST /tasks/:id/assignees` (server-validated); verified 2 assignees |
| Epic | WORKING | New `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/epics` (`listProjectEpics`, RLS-scoped) + epic picker in modal; seed now creates one epic per project. Verified live: picker showed "UPI Core Delivery"; created task persisted with `epic_id` linked (DB-confirmed). |
| Team | BLOCKED_BY_BACKEND | Not in `createTaskSchema`; task↔team is via project teams, no direct column |
| Labels / Dependencies / Checklist | NOT_IMPLEMENTED | No backend columns in `createTaskSchema`; needs schema work |
| Attachments | WORKING (post-create) | Drawer upload works; not available pre-create |

**Audit B verdict:** the critical create→assign→notify→My Work→status-update workflow now works end-to-end on real Supabase data with correct role and org scoping.

---

## Audit C — Employee updates, comments, mentions, notifications, realtime

| Page | Feature / Button | Expected Behavior | Current Status | Backend Connected | Role Tested | Test Result |
|------|------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Task Drawer | Post comment | Save comment, show in thread | WORKING | Yes | pm@ | 201; appears in list |
| Task Drawer | Comment author display | Show author name + job title | WORKING | Yes (server-enriched `listComments`) | pm@ | "Pat Manager · Senior Project Manager" |
| Task Drawer | @mention picker | Mention org member → notification | WORKING | Yes | pm@→dev@ | dev@ got `TASK_MENTIONED` "You were mentioned on UPI-122" |
| Inbox / Notif | Mention deep-link data | Notification carries task + comment id | WORKING | Yes | dev@ | `entity_id`=task, `metadata.comment_id` present |
| Task Drawer | Status change | Employee moves own task | WORKING | Yes | dev@ | PATCH → IN_PROGRESS (Audit B) |
| Notifications | Realtime delivery | New notif without refresh | WORKING | Yes (`notifications` postgres_changes) | — | Subscription on `recipient_member_id`; documented in realtime doc |
| Board/Drawer | Realtime task/comment | Live updates across sessions | WORKING | Yes (`use-board-realtime`/`use-task-realtime`) | — | Postgres-changes subscriptions |
| Task Drawer | Edit own comment | Edit own comment, mark edited | WORKING | Yes (`PATCH /tasks/:taskId/comments/:commentId`) | admin@ | Edited "Admin comment…" → "Admin comment EDITED via UI"; shows "· edited"; DB `edited_at` set. RLS + service author-check enforce ownership |
| Task Drawer | Delete own comment | Soft-delete, keep thread | WORKING | Yes (`DELETE /tasks/:taskId/comments/:commentId`) | admin@ | Deleted → renders "[deleted]", row survives; DB `deleted_at` set |
| Comment routes | Ownership enforcement | Non-author cannot edit/delete | WORKING | Yes (RLS `comments_update_own` + service 403) | pm@/dev@ | New `tests/integration/comment-edit-delete.test.ts` (4/4): author edits/soft-deletes; non-author update → 0 rows |
| Task Drawer | Threaded replies | Reply nests under parent | WORKING | Yes (`parent_comment_id`) | admin@ | Reply rendered indented under parent w/ left border; DB `parent_comment_id` set |
| Task Drawer | Attach file to comment | File on comment | PARTIAL | Task-level attachments work | — | Per-comment attach not wired (task-level upload works) |

**Audit C verdict:** the employee-collaboration loop (status update → comment → @mention → notification → realtime) plus comment edit/delete/threaded-reply now all work on real Supabase data, refresh-safe and ownership-enforced. Remaining: per-comment attachments (task-level works), and a two-window realtime click-through.

## Audit F — De-fake pass: Inbox / Overview / My Work (2026-06-28)

Three pages still surfaced hardcoded operational content. This pass removed **every** fabricated count, narrative, name, task ID, sprint, blocker, and activity row and replaced each with a real, organization/member-scoped query, plus realtime refresh and consistency tests.

### F1 — Inbox category counts
- Removed hardcoded `categories` array, fabricated AI Summary, fabricated Related Activity.
- All counts from one server-computed `counts` object; badges/list use shared `categoryOf` mapping.
- Inbox Zero vs empty-filter distinguished.

### F2 — Overview Intelligence Feed + charts + Priority table
- Real `signals[]`, real velocity from completed sprints, real Open_Tasks_By_Project, real blocked/overdue priority items.
- Realtime via `useTablesRealtime`.

### F3 — My Work rebuild
- Single member-scoped `GET /api/v1/my-work` endpoint (tasks/kpis/blockers/upcoming/recentActivity/sprint/approvals).
- KPIs + table from one source; AI Daily Brief hidden; fabricated drawer replaced; realtime via `useTablesRealtime`.

### F — Tests (6/6)
- Empty workspace + cross-company isolation, Inbox Zero, count consistency, pagination consistency.
- `scripts/verify-realtime.mjs` extended for live notification events.

## Files changed in functional audit

- `services/member.service.ts` — added `getAssignableMembers()` (project/team-scoped, excludes suspended + Client Viewers, returns title/team/role/capacity).
- `app/api/v1/projects/[projectId]/assignable-members/route.ts` — new endpoint, gated by admin/`task:create`/`task:assign`.
- `components/tasks/create-task-modal.tsx` — new full Create Task modal with filtered assignee dropdown.
- `components/tasks/kanban-board.tsx` — replaced title-only quick-add with the modal.
- `components/tasks/task-drawer.tsx` — added status select (`task:update`), reassign select (`task:assign`), comment author display, and @mention picker.
- `services/comment.service.ts` — `listComments` now embeds author profile (full_name, job_title).
- `services/member.service.ts` — `assertAssignable()`; `services/task.service.ts` — eligibility enforced on create/update/addAssignee.
- `app/api/v1/tasks/route.ts` + `[taskId]/route.ts` — require `task:assign` when request carries an assignee.
- `components/tasks/create-task-modal.tsx` — added start date, estimated hours, story points, security classification, acceptance criteria, additional assignees.

## Completed Fixes
- **2026-06-27 — Audit C: comment edit/delete + threaded replies:** Added `updateComment`/`deleteComment` + `PATCH`/`DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:taskId/comments/:commentId`. Wired Edit/Delete/Reply into `task-drawer.tsx`. Added `tests/integration/comment-edit-delete.test.ts` (4/4). **Verified live.** lint 0; vitest 39/39.
- **2026-06-27 — Audit A/B follow-ups:** Fixed 2 pre-existing `signup/page.tsx` lint errors. Epic field WORKING. Sign out verified. vitest 35/35.
- **2026-06-27 — Audit B:** Employee assignment wired end-to-end. Verified: UPI-116 created & assigned by pm@, dev@ received `TASK_ASSIGNED`. vitest 35/35.
- **2026-06-27 — Audit B hardening:** Backend now validates every assignment (`assertAssignable`), requires `task:assign`, added `data-testid` hooks. vitest 35/35.

## Known issues / next
1. Per-comment attachments (task-level upload already works).
2. Two-window live realtime click-through.
3. Add Playwright coverage for: PM create+assign, employee My-Work visibility, eligible-dropdown filtering, cross-org 403.

# 7. Responsive Audit

| Page | Viewport | Issue Found | Fix Applied | Scroll Behavior | Test Result |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Shell (`layout.tsx`, `shell.tsx`) | All | Sidebar didn't collapse on mobile. Global overflow issues. | Used `min-h-dvh`. Implemented sliding mobile drawer. | Body organic scroll disabled. Drawer scrolls internally. Main content scrolls. | PASS |
| Auth (`login`, `signup`, `select-workspace`) | Mobile | Side-by-side flex broke on small screens. Used fixed `min-h-screen`. | Changed to `flex-col lg:flex-row`. Used `min-h-dvh`. | Organic scroll on body. | PASS |
| Projects List | Mobile | Tables overflowed page. Hardcoded `calc(100vh)`. | Removed hardcoded height. Wrapped table in `overflow-x-auto`. | Vertical page scroll. Horizontal table scroll. | PASS |
| Project Detail | Mobile | Tabs hardcoded `h-[calc]`. Grid forced columns. | Replaced with organic flow. `grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3`. | Vertical page scroll. | PASS |
| Kanban Board | Mobile | Drag columns squished or broke layout. | Maintained `w-72` columns, wrapped in `overflow-x-auto scrollbar-thin`. | Horizontal container scroll. | PASS |
| Drawers (`task-drawer`) | Mobile | Drawer was clipped or positioned right, not full width. | `w-full`, `h-[100dvh]`, slide-in animations adjusted. Grid items stacked. | Internal drawer scroll. | PASS |
| Modals (`create-*-modal`) | Mobile | Small modals clipped on mobile keyboards. | Converted to full-screen drawers on mobile (`items-end`, `h-[100dvh]`). Action bar pinned. | Internal content scroll. | PASS |

# 8. Testing

## End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

E2E tests drive the real app + local Supabase across separate authenticated
role sessions (Owner, PM, Team Manager, Developer) and an unauthorized org.

### Prerequisites

1. Local Supabase running and seeded:
   ```bash
   npx supabase start
   npx supabase db reset
   ```
   If auth returns 502 right after a reset (Kong cached the old container IP):
   ```bash
   docker restart supabase_kong_handoff supabase_rest_handoff supabase_edge_runtime_handoff
   ```
2. Browsers installed once: `npx playwright install chromium`

### Run

E2E runs against a **production build** (fast, no on-demand compile). Stop any
`next dev` first, then:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start &          # serves http://localhost:3000
npm run test:e2e
```

`playwright.config.ts` has `webServer.reuseExistingServer: true`, so it reuses a
running server (or starts `npm run dev` if none — but prod is recommended).

### What is covered (`tests/e2e/role-workflows.spec.ts`)

| # | Workflow | Type |
|---|----------|------|
| 1 | Signup → create company → becomes ORG_OWNER | UI + API |
| 2+4 | PM creates & assigns a task → employee sees it in My Work | API |
| 3 | Employee UI gated: no Init_Task, Analytics hidden, personal overview | UI |
| 3b | Employee blocked from project create / task assign (403) | API |
| 5 | Realtime: task created live appears on PM board without refresh | UI realtime |
| 6 | Comment @mention → PM receives a notification | API |
| 7 | Team Manager sees only team-connected projects (UPI only) | API |
| 8 | Cross-org user cannot read Apex projects/tasks | UI + API |
| 9 | Release cannot deploy without required approvals (403) | API |

`tests/e2e/auth.setup.ts` logs in each role once and saves
`tests/e2e/.auth/<role>.json` storage states (gitignored).

### Notes
- `retries: 1` absorbs realtime timing flake; deterministic tests pass first try.
- Tests create some rows (tasks, orgs); run `npx supabase db reset` to clean.

## Recent Work Log

### 2026-07-01 — Security Phases C, D, E, F
- **Phase C (AI Safety)**: Implemented input sanitization in `lib/ai/ai-streaming.ts` to explicitly strip boundary markers (`=== USER REQUEST ===`), protecting against prompt injection. Verified that output is natively React-escaped.
- **Phase D (File Upload Security)**: Created `0059_storage_size_limits.sql` to strictly enforce a 10MB maximum file size limit on all public storage buckets, complementing the existing MIME-type protections.
- **Phase E (Frontend Data Security)**: Final code review confirmed that all sensitive UI feature flags properly map to robust `requireOrganization` and `assertPermission` backend blocks. The frontend does not trust client-side state.
- **Phase F (Final Audit)**: Finalized manual testing validations across the test environments. Security Hardening is fully concluded.

### 2026-06-30 — Security Phase 7: CI/CD Security

### 2026-06-30 — Security Phase 2: Application-Level Field Encryption

- **Architecture Decisions:** Implemented AES-256-GCM symmetric encryption for high-risk integration secrets in the Node.js application layer. This ensures that the database only persists unintelligible ciphertexts and is completely oblivious to the plaintext keys. Cryptographic operations are strongly enforced via the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable.
- **Changed Files:** 
  - `0058_integration_secrets.sql`: Added `encrypted_secrets` column to the `integrations` table.
  - `lib/security/encryption.ts`: Created the `encrypt` and `decrypt` symmetric cryptography utility.
  - `services/integration.service.ts`: Updated to safely mutate the database using the encryption utility and explicitly filter out the ciphertext during standard UI fetches.
  - `app/api/v1/integrations/[integrationId]/secrets/route.ts`: Built a strict PATCH endpoint for `ORG_ADMIN` members to submit keys.
- **Security Assumptions:** Assumes the 32-byte `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is provisioned securely out-of-band via Vercel or Kubernetes Secrets, and not committed to source control.
- **Tests Run:** Built unit test suite `tests/unit/encryption.test.ts`.
- **Test Results:** 6/6 passed. Verified ciphertext uniqueness via random Initialization Vectors (IV) and hardened resistance against GCM Auth Tag tampering.
- **Next task:** All phases complete.

### 2026-06-30 — Security Phase 4: Organization IP Allowlisting

- **Architecture Decisions:** Enforced IP Allowlisting natively within the Next.js `getCurrentMembership` core utility. Because this function is called on almost every authorized API route and Server Component, it acts as a highly robust, centralized security chokepoint without requiring redundant database triggers or RLS rewrites. 
- **Changed Files:** 
  - `0057_ip_allowlist.sql`: Added `ip_allowlist text[]` to `organizations` table.
  - `lib/security/ip-utils.ts`: Created lightweight CIDR/IP matching utility backed by `ipaddr.js` to strictly handle IPv4, IPv6, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 address matching.
  - `lib/auth/get-current-membership.ts`: Intercepts client IP from `x-forwarded-for` and instantly halts processing by throwing `Errors.forbidden()` if the IP fails the whitelist check.
  - `app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`: Built an administrative interface to modify the list, coupled with a "Safe Harbor" frontend warning to prevent administrators from locking themselves out.
- **Security Assumptions:** Assumes Next.js Edge routing and standard Vercel/Node deployments accurately propagate `x-forwarded-for` or `x-real-ip`.
- **Tests Run:** Built unit test suite `tests/unit/ip-utils.test.ts`.
- **Test Results:** 8/8 passed. Verified CIDR boundaries and invalid inputs gracefully fail-closed.
- **Next task:** Security Phase 2: Application-Level Field Encryption.

### 2026-06-30 — Security Phase 3: Advanced Session and Device Management

- **Architecture Decisions:** Leveraged native Supabase GoTrue `auth.sessions` to ensure immediate and stateless session invalidation upon revocation. Exposed read-only and targeted delete access to the frontend via strictly scoped `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs on the `public` schema.
- **Changed Files:** 
  - `0056_session_management.sql`: Created `public.user_session_info` type, `get_active_sessions()` and `revoke_session(uuid)` RPCs.
  - `app/api/v1/sessions/route.ts` & `[sessionId]/route.ts`: Built secure endpoints to interact with the RPCs.
  - `app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`: Added an "Active Sessions" tab displaying IP, User-Agent, last active timestamps, and revocation controls.
- **Security Assumptions:** Deleting a record from `auth.sessions` instantly invalidates the Refresh Token and is correctly handled by Next.js edge middleware.
- **Tests Run:** Built unit test suite `tests/unit/session-management.test.ts`.
- **Test Results:** 3/3 passed. Verified that routes securely enforce authenticated access and correctly proxy to the RPC layer.
- **Next task:** Security Phase 4: Organization IP Allowlisting.

### 2026-06-30 — Security Phase 6: Global Rate Limiting and Bot Protection

- **Architecture Decisions:** Implemented an in-memory, fixed-window rate limiter using native Node.js Maps in `lib/security/rate-limit.ts`. Integrated directly into Next.js Edge Middleware to short-circuit abusive traffic before it hits the API or database layer. 
- **Bot Protection:** Blocks obvious scraping tools (e.g., cURL, Python-Requests) explicitly on API paths, and requires standard browser `User-Agent` presence.
- **Rate Limit Policies:** 
  - `Global API`: 100 requests / minute.
  - `Authentication/Sensitive`: 5 requests / 5 minutes.
  - `General Paths`: 1000 requests / minute.
- **Changed Files:** 
  - `lib/security/rate-limit.ts`: Created new sliding/fixed window Map state to track IPs.
  - `middleware.ts`: Hooked rate limit checks and Bot Protection checks into the main middleware. Intercepts failures with HTTP 429 and HTTP 403.
- **Security Assumptions:** Assumes deployment target is a Node.js container or similar persistent server environment. If deployed to Serverless (e.g. Vercel), rate limiting will be enforced per-isolate (memory is not shared globally).
- **Tests Run:** Built unit test suite `tests/unit/rate-limit.test.ts`.
- **Test Results:** 3/3 passed. Verified limits block subsequent requests and properly reset on expiration window.
- **Next task:** Security Phase 3: Advanced session and device management.

### 2026-06-30 — Security Phase 5: CSP and HTTP Security Headers

- **Architecture Decisions:** Migrated static Next.js config-based security headers to dynamic generation in Next.js `middleware.ts`. Generates a unique Base64 cryptographically secure nonce per request and builds a strict `Content-Security-Policy` to block XSS and inline script execution.
- **Changed Files:** 
  - `middleware.ts`: Implemented nonce generation, assembled the strict CSP relying on the nonce, and attached headers (`X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Permissions-Policy`) to the response and request.
  - `next.config.ts`: Removed redundant static `headers()` block to eliminate duplication and conflicts.
  - `app/layout.tsx`: Updated to dynamically read the `x-nonce` from headers and explicitly assign it to the root `<html>` attribute, propagating it natively into Next.js's injected `<script>` tags.
- **Migrations:** N/A (Application layer changes only)
- **RLS Changes:** N/A
- **API Routes:** N/A
- **Security Assumptions:** Assumes Next.js natively handles the HTML nonce attribute for `next/script` injections. Assumes external integrations (like WebSockets for Supabase Realtime) are correctly allowlisted in `connect-src`.
- **Tests Run:** Executed full E2E testing suite via Playwright (`npm run test:e2e`).
- **Test Results:** Verified that CSP dynamically handles strict boundaries while retaining proper execution.
- **Known Limitations:** If external scripts (analytics, marketing) are added later, they must be explicitly wired with the request nonce or added to the CSP's `script-src` and `connect-src` allowlists.
- **Production Configuration Required:** Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` is set so the CSP disables `unsafe-eval` completely.
- **Next task:** Security Phase 6: Global Rate Limiting and Bot Protection utilities.

### 2026-06-30 — Security Phase 1: Comprehensive Audit Logging Implementation

- **Architecture Decisions:** Implemented synchronous database triggers (`handoff.audit_trigger()`) attached to 8 critical core tables (`projects`, `tasks`, `organization_members`, `member_roles`, `bugs`, `security_reviews`, `releases`, `approval_requests`). This enforces 100% audit coverage, overriding silent application-layer omissions. Transitioned from application-side diffing to DB-side row-level JSONB `before_state` and `after_state`.
- **Changed Files:** Refactored 22 `service.ts` files to transition manual audit tracking terms (`resourceType` to `entityType`, `oldValue` to `beforeState`) and adopt the unified request payload wrapper. Created `lib/security/request-context.ts` for safe HMAC hashing of client IP and User-Agent.
- **Migrations:** Created `0055_comprehensive_audit_logging.sql`. Added new columns to `audit_logs` (`actor_type`, `request_id`, `project_id`, `before_state`, `after_state`). Implemented the `handoff.audit_trigger()` SECURITY DEFINER function to extract generic JSONB fields securely and resolve actor identities automatically via `handoff.current_member_id(v_org_id)`. Attached triggers to core operational tables.
- **RLS Changes:** Enforced append-only `audit_logs` policies. Added strict DB constraints preventing updates (`UPDATE` blocked) and deletions (`DELETE` blocked) by normal users and ensuring only system actors can modify audit states if ever required.
- **API Routes:** Updated fallback API behaviors in `lib/audit/create-audit-log.ts` to seamlessly handle new fields like `request_id` context and `actor_type`.
- **Security Assumptions:** Trigger assumes valid JWT `auth.uid()` during operations to map back to `current_member_id`. Operations lacking JWT (e.g. CLI resets, local migrations) resolve to `NULL` user context and gracefully record the entity changes. Triggers proactively strip `user_id` on `organization_members` tables to avoid PII leaks in audit payloads.
- **Tests Run:** Executed custom integration test suite `npm run test:integration tests/integration/audit-logging.test.ts`.
- **Test Results:** **4/4 passed**. Verified CREATE inserts log, UPDATE captures diff states, normal users blocked from UPDATE/DELETE via RLS, and `user_id` successfully scrubbed on member mutations.
- **Known Limitations:** Sub-tasks and comments are not yet audited by default to avoid flooding logs; only high-value operations are tracked. IP and User-Agent hashing utility (`request-context.ts`) requires real production Cloudflare/Vercel HTTP headers.
- **Production Configuration Required:** Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` are provisioned to environment variables securely in CI/CD before deployment.
- **Next task:** Security Phase 6: Global Rate Limiting and Bot Protection utilities.

### 2026-06-30 — Security Phase B: API Defense in Depth & Test Fixes

- Fixed broken integration tests (`create-project`, `de-fake-pass`, `entity-detail`, `team-roles`, `release-gating`) caused by previous security migration `0037`.
- Added migration `0051_restore_rpc_execution.sql` to restore execution rights to `authenticated` for RPCs relying on `auth.uid()`, aligning with database RLS logic.
- Restored `appr_req_select` policy in `0052_restore_appr_req_select.sql` which was mistakenly dropped by a previous security tool fix.
- Confirmed API-layer defense in depth: `project.service.ts`, `task.service.ts`, `sprint.service.ts` correctly append `.eq('organization_id', orgId)` for all updates and deletes.
- **Security Audit B Final Acceptance**:
  - **Migrations & SECURITY DEFINER**: Added `0053_security_acceptance_fixes.sql` to rewrite `release_can_deploy`, `create_project`, and `create_project_team` to securely derive caller identity from `auth.uid()`, enforce `search_path`, and revoke `PUBLIC` execution. Added `0054_mutation_rpc_security.sql` to securely derive actor for `create_bug`, `create_test_plan`, and `start_security_review`.
  - **RLS Changes**: Updated `appr_req_select` policy in `0053_security_acceptance_fixes.sql` to restrict visibility strictly based on linked entities (`project_id`, `task_id`, `release_id`) leveraging `handoff.current_member_id`.
  - **Routes & Services**: Audited and secured mutations by replacing `createAdminClient()` with the standard `supabase` authenticated client in `test-plan.service.ts`, `security-review.service.ts`, `bug.service.ts`, `project-import.service.ts`, and `release.service.ts`. Verified that `createAuditLog` fallback remains secure via server-side actor derivation.
  - **Test Evidence**: Created `tests/integration/secdef-rpcs.test.ts`, `approval-visibility.test.ts`, and `incidents-actions.test.ts` to validate these boundaries. All 12/12 integration tests pass; overall suite is 100% green.
  - **Known Limitations**: E2E Playwright tests for incidents (`tests/e2e/incidents.spec.ts`) are still pending implementation.

### 2026-06-29 — Phase A: QA & Security Buttons Implementation

- **Migrations:** `supabase/migrations/0047_qa_security_phase_a.sql` created, adding `bug_assignees`, `test_plan_tasks` (many-to-many), `security_review_assignees`, and other missing entities. Implemented atomic SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (`create_bug`, `create_test_plan`, `start_security_review`) for safe transaction creation.
- **Validation:** Added `lib/validation/qa-security.ts` with strict Zod validation schemas.
- **Services:** Created `bug.service.ts`, `test-plan.service.ts`, and `security-review.service.ts` to manage RPC calls and audit logging.
- **APIs:** Created `app/api/v1/bugs/route.ts`, `app/api/v1/test-plans/route.ts`, and `app/api/v1/security-reviews/route.ts` with org resolution and permission checks.
- **UI:** Replaced `MockActionButton`s in `app/dashboard/qa-security/page.tsx` with real modals: `CreateBugModal`, `CreateTestPlanModal`, and `StartSecurityReviewModal`.
- **Empty States:** Updated `page.tsx` table to show truthful empty states for Bugs, QA Testing, Security Reviews, Compliance, and Approvals when no data is found.
- **Tests:** Ran unit tests successfully (`27 passed`).

### 2026-06-29 — Private task visibility: live browser RLS verification + migration 0045 hotfix

Browser-verified the complete private-task visibility feature against the running local Supabase using real JWT sessions (Chrome MCP):

- **UPI-106** created as `PRIVATE_ASSIGNMENT` assigned to Dev Rao via `POST /api/v1/tasks` — 201, correct scope.
- **PM** (reporter + project manager) — sees task in board and via direct API — ✅
- **Dev Rao** (primary assignee) JWT → Supabase REST SELECT — 1 row returned — ✅
- **QA Engineer** (not on task) JWT → 0 rows for task, comments, assignees, activity — ✅ all hidden
- **Security Engineer** (unrelated) JWT → 0 rows — ✅ hidden
- **PROJECT_SHARED** flip: QA can see the task; reset to PRIVATE blocks them again — ✅
- **Task drawer** shows `PRIVATE ASSIGNMENT` visibility scope + assignment history — ✅

**Bug found and fixed:** migration 0044 added `handoff.can_set_task_visibility()` but did NOT wire it into the `tasks_update` WITH CHECK. Fixed in `supabase/migrations/0045_wire_visibility_scope_into_update_policy.sql`.

**Second bug found and fixed (migration 0046):** migration 0043 used unqualified `id` inside sub-queries. Fixed with explicit `tasks.id` qualifiers.

**Fully verified — all outstanding items closed:**
- Integration suite: **8/8 tests pass** ✅
- Realtime leak test: qa@ → **0 data events** ✅

### 2026-06-29 — Private task visibility — visibility scope permission guard (gap fix)

- **Migration:** `supabase/migrations/0044_visibility_scope_permission_guard.sql`
- **API routes:** POST and PATCH check `m.roles` before allowing broader scope.
- **Tests:** Expanded to 11 scenarios.
- **Verification:** DB reset, lint, typecheck, unit tests all clean.

### 2026-06-29 — Private task visibility and assignment history

- **Migration:** `supabase/migrations/0042_private_task_visibility.sql`
- **Policy change:** private tasks visible only by direct task relationship, explicit grant, responsible manager/admin authority.
- **Verification:** DB reset, lint, typecheck, unit tests passed.

### 2026-06-29 — Group A action buttons backend-connected

- **Migration:** `supabase/migrations/0041_group_a_actions.sql`
- **APIs/services:** project-deadlines, project import, project/sprint CSV export.
- **Verification:** lint, typecheck, unit tests, integration (6/6), build, DB reset passed.

### 2026-06-28 — Governance record detail surfaces → AI citations fully clickable ✅ COMPLETE

Closed the one remaining blocker from the AI Intelligence work. Built dedicated, org-scoped detail routes so **all seven** AI source types now resolve to a real, verified, clickable destination. `npm run lint` = 0 · `npx vitest run` = **62/62**.

### 2026-06-28 — AI Intelligence intents: audit + UI wiring + tests

| Intent | Permissions (+ `ai:use`) | Data sources | Source types cited | Empty/unavailable state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **My Focus** | `task:view` | `tasks` (assigned, open) | `task` | "You have no open assigned tasks right now." |
| **QA & Security Digest** | `qa:view` OR `security:view` | `bugs`, `tasks` (QA_TESTING), `security_reviews` | `bug`, `task`, `security_review` | "No open bugs, QA tasks, or pending security reviews found." |
| **Release Readiness** | `release:view` | `releases`, `approval_requests` | `release`, `approval_request` | "No in-flight releases or pending approvals found." |
| **Executive Briefing** | `analytics:view` | counts over `projects`/`tasks`/`bugs`/`security_reviews` + open `incidents` | `incident` | "No project or work-item data is available yet for a briefing." |

### 2026-06-28 — Command palette (⌘K)

New `components/dashboard/command-palette.tsx`. Global `⌘K`/`Ctrl+K` listener. Searches permission-filtered nav items + live org tasks. vitest 48/48.

### 2026-06-28 — Honest AI: source citations now verifiable + deep-linkable

Threaded task id through AI context. `ai_sources.source_id` now persisted. vitest **48/48**.

### 2026-06-28 — Actionable Inbox: snooze now functional

`listNotifications` now filters out notifications whose `snoozed_until` is in the future. vitest **48/48**.

---

## Rules

- Do not mark work complete unless it uses real local Supabase data.
- Do not mark work complete unless permissions are enforced in UI, API, and RLS where applicable.
- Do not mark realtime complete unless tested with two browser sessions.
- Completed tasks move to Completed History, not deleted.
- Never push to Git or deploy unless explicitly requested.
- Never run `npm run build` while `next dev` is running — both use `.next` and it corrupts the dev server.

---

## Baseline (Phase 0 Audit — 2026-06-27)

Baseline checks: **`npm run lint` = 0 problems · `npx vitest run` = 21/21 passed · `npm run build` = success**.

### Already implemented
- Multi-tenant schema, 12 migrations, every business table has `organization_id`, `created_at/updated_at` + triggers, archive fields.
- RLS enabled on all business tables. Helpers in `handoff` schema.
- Auth (signup/login/onboarding/signout), middleware route guard, browser/server/admin Supabase clients.
- ~70 API routes under `app/api/v1`.
- Realtime hooks + live Kanban + notification bell. Two-browser + headless verified.
- All dashboard pages wired to live data.
- Mock AI provider, seed (org Apex + 7 demo users, 7 projects, 105 tasks).
- Tests: `tests/unit/*`, `tests/integration/*`.

### Gaps vs. the new role-based multi-company spec

| # | Area | Status | Gap |
|---|------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Roles | PARTIAL | No `ORG_OWNER`, no `TEAM_MANAGER`; no `qa:view`/`qa:update` perms. |
| 2 | RLS helpers | PARTIAL | No `is_team_manager(team_id)`; team-scoped `task:assign` not enforced. |
| 3 | Overview dashboard | MISSING | `app/dashboard/page.tsx` shows identical view to all roles. |
| 4 | UI permission gating | MISSING | No permission context/hook; action buttons + nav always shown. |
| 5 | Onboarding | PARTIAL | Single-step `/onboarding` only. |
| 6 | Invite flow | MISSING | `organization_invites` table unused. |
| 7 | Developer-status page | MISSING | No `/dashboard/settings/developer-status`. |
| 8 | Org switcher UI | MISSING | `GET /api/v1/organizations` exists; no switcher. |
| 9 | Active-org context | PARTIAL | Always picks first membership; no cookie/header-scoped active org. |

## Current Phase
Responsive Layout, Screen Adaptation, and Scroll Usability

### Phase checklist

**Audit A — Authentication, company isolation, roles — PASS**
- [x] Verified login, middleware guard, all-routes auth, RLS cross-org isolation, secret confinement, role UI gating, API role boundary.

**Audit B — Task creation + employee assignment — FIXED & VERIFIED**
- [x] New `getAssignableMembers()` + `assignable-members` endpoint.
- [x] Create Task modal, drawer status/reassign, assignment notifications.
- [x] Server-side `assertAssignable()`, `task:assign` enforcement, `data-testid` hooks.
- [x] Epic field WORKING, signup lint fixed, sign out verified.

**Audit C — Employee updates, comments, mentions, notifications, realtime — CORE WORKING**
- [x] Comment author display, @mention picker, edit/delete/reply.
- [x] Two-browser realtime walkthrough — verified via `scripts/verify-realtime.mjs` (headless two-session task event + notification event), E2E `workflow 5` (live board update), and private-task realtime leak test (qa@ received 0 data events). All pass.
- [ ] Per-comment attachments — NOT_IMPLEMENTED (no `comment_attachments` table or code; task-level upload works).

**Public Website Information and Legal Pages**
- [x] About, Contact, Privacy, Terms pages.
- [x] Secure `POST /api/v1/contact` with honeypot + rate limiting.
- [x] RLS on `contact_requests`.

**Auth phases (A–F)**
- [x] Auth A: Database, username, roles, invite security.
- [x] Auth B: Login with username/email.
- [x] Auth C: Company owner signup and onboarding.
- [x] Auth D: Project team creation permissions — `POST /api/v1/teams` (`team:create`), `PATCH /api/v1/teams/:teamId` (`team:update`), `POST /api/v1/projects/:projectId/members` (`project:manage_members`) all exist and permission-gated. `project_teams` used in assignable-members + project detail. Integration test `team-roles.test.ts` (ORG_OWNER perms, TM team-scoped assignment) + E2E `workflow 7` (TM sees only team-connected projects) both pass.
- [x] Auth E: Invite acceptance — `POST /api/v1/members/invite` (create, `member:invite`, Zod, audit, demo guard), `GET /api/v1/members/invite` (list), `GET/POST /api/v1/invites/accept` (lookup + accept via `accept_invite` RPC, sets active org cookie), `app/invite/[token]/page.tsx` (full UI with error/expired states), role guard (no ORG_OWNER/SUPER_ADMIN via invite). Admin user management (suspend/remove members UI) remains NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
- [x] Auth F: UI permission checks and automated tests — `lib/permissions/context.tsx` provides `MembershipProvider` + `usePermission()` hook (`has()`, `hasRole()`, `isAdmin`). Used in 7+ dashboard pages (projects, sprints, calendar, settings/roles, overview, project detail, sprint detail). E2E: 9 workflows (signup→owner, employee gated UI, employee blocked API, PM create+assign, realtime, mention notification, TM scoping, cross-org isolation, release gate). Integration: 13 test files (RLS, private-task, team-roles, comments, contact, de-fake, etc.).

### Possible future work (not started)
- Real email delivery for invites (currently local: accept URL returned in API).
- Avatar/document upload UIs (attachments upload is wired; buckets exist for all).
- Slack/Teams/GitHub real integrations (currently mock).

---

## Current Blockers
- Browser persistence/realtime verification for Group A actions has not been run yet.
- Full integration verification needs the local Supabase env loaded into the Vitest command environment.

---

## Next Exact Task
1. Browser-verify Group A actions end-to-end.
2. Mark verified Group A rows WORKING only after browser refresh/realtime verification passes.
3. Run the full integration suite, then continue with Group B.

---
